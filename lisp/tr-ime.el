;;; Commentary:

;; Emulator of GNU Emacs IME patch for Windows (tr-ime) emulates the C
;; implementation part of an IME patch for GNU Emacs that allows to input
;; Japanese using the Windows IME (Input Method Editor).  On Emacs 26.2 or
;; later, Japanese input using the IME is now possible even without the IME
;; patch.  However, some of the features of the IME patch are not implemented
;; in current Emacs, so it is possible to type Japanese on Emacs without the
;; IME patch, but it is not convenient.
;;
;; w32-ime.el in the w32-ime package manages the upper layer of the IME
;; patch and provides the convenient features but it could not be used on
;; emacs.exe without the IME patch applied.  tr-ime emulates the lower
;; layers of the IME patches and can interact with w32-ime.el.  So, using
;; tr-ime, w32-ime.el can be used on emacs.exe without the IME patch applied.
;;
;; By using tr-ime and w32-ime.el together, emacs.exe without the IME patch
;; can use the same convenient features as the IME patched emacs.exe.  They
;; can display the on/off state of the IME in the mode line as UI/UX features.
;; They also have hooks to call when the IME state is changed.  With these
;; hooks, you can change the color and shape of the cursor depending on the
;; IME on/off status to be visually known to the IME state.

;; To use standard features (stable but less functionality) of the tr-ime
;; package, add the following code to your init.el or .emacs
;; It loads the tr-ime-mod DLL module if you use Emacs 27.
;;
;;   (tr-ime-standard-install)
;;
;; To use advanced features (experimental but more functionality) of the
;; tr-ime package, add the following code to your init.el or .emacs
;; It loads the tr-ime-modadv DLL module.
